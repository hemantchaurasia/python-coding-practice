### Know the Python libraries and frameworks along with their purposes:

**1. Django:** Django is a powerful web framework that follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It provides a high-level abstraction for building web applications rapidly and efficiently. Django handles many common web development tasks such as URL routing, database management, authentication, and form handling.

**2. Flask:** Flask is a lightweight web framework that is easy to learn and use. It provides the essentials for web development and allows flexibility in choosing components as needed. Flask is often used for smaller projects or APIs due to its simplicity and minimalistic design.

**3. NumPy:** NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing and data analysis in Python. It provides powerful tools for working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions. NumPy is widely used in fields such as data science, machine learning, and numerical simulations.

**4. Pandas:** pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures (such as DataFrames and Series) and functions to efficiently handle and process structured data. pandas is extensively used in data exploration, cleaning, transformation, and preparation tasks before applying machine learning algorithms.

**5. Matplotlib:** Matplotlib is a plotting library that enables the creation of various types of visualizations, including line plots, scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and more. It provides a flexible API for customizing plots and is often used for data visualization and exploratory analysis.

**6. Scikit-learn:** scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library that provides a wide range of algorithms and tools for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. It also includes modules for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and model selection. scikit-learn is widely used for building and deploying machine learning models in Python.

**7. TensorFlow:** TensorFlow is an open-source library primarily used for developing and deploying deep learning models. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, including flexible neural network architectures, optimization algorithms, and visualization tools. TensorFlow enables efficient computation on CPUs and GPUs and supports deployment on a variety of platforms.

**8. Keras:** Keras is a high-level neural networks library that runs on top of TensorFlow. It simplifies the process of building deep learning models by providing a user-friendly API. Keras is known for its ease of use, flexibility, and compatibility with various neural network architectures.
